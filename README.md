Known Issues:
- GitPython uses the System Git and probably fails if there is no Git installed
- If the Git version is more recent, there is no progress meter
- The Progress Meter is laggy
- There is no "finished" dialog
- The main selection window pops up again after an installation
- The main progress window is clunky
- Everything is placed in the main ES folder
- No symlinks, no menu entries, just a folder
